Oh-My-Zsh
=========
Set your shell to use zsh.

```
chsh -s `which zsh`
```

```
git clone git://github.com/marr/oh-my-zsh.git
```

Git
===
Enter your name and email

```
vim .gitconfig
```

Some of my more opinioned settings are in ```.zlogin```. I source a ```.shenv``` file
thats not in git, as its machine-specific in case you want to put in some
environment specific stuff. 

TODO
====
Test if .shenv exists before trying to source to make a more portable install.

Other assumptions I make in ```.zlogin``` include ```rvm``` being installed and a
local clone of https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.

Plugins for zsh I use are git, osx, node, brew, github.
